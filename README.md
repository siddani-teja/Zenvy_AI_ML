Anamoly detection using Unsupervised learning


This project focuses on detecting anomalous employee behavior using an unsupervised machine learning technique called Isolation Forest. The system analyzes employee-related attributes such as role, department, salary, and overtime hours to identify unusual patterns that may indicate anomalies such as payroll irregularities or abnormal work behavior.

The project uses a synthetically generated dataset to simulate real-world scenarios where anomalous records are rare compared to normal records.

## Objectives:

*)To generate a realistic employee dataset with normal and anomalous patterns

*)To preprocess categorical and numerical data for machine learning

*)To apply Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm

*)To identify and extract anomalous employee records from the entire dataset

*)To evaluate model performance using standard metrics
